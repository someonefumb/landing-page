# Landing Page
A landing page for giraffes.

## Reflection
I made a landing page for a website. It was fun but it took a while to get everything done because I stalled around too much. Maybe I could try writing down what I need to do on paper before any typing. Anyways, flex is really useful for making things flexible to fit on pages.
